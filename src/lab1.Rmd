```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(dplyr)
```

### Read in the SF trees data
```{r}
sf_trees <- read_csv(here("data", "sf_trees", "sf_trees.csv"))
```

### Basic Wrangling Reminders

Refresh some skills for data wrangling and summary statistics using functions in the 'dplyr' package

Find the top 5 highest observations of trees by legal_status, do some wrangling, make a graph.
```{r}
top_5_status <- sf_trees %>%
  count(legal_status) %>% 
  drop_na(legal_status) %>% #remove N/A row
  rename(tree_count = n) %>% # new name on the left, old name on the right
  relocate(tree_count) %>% # moved tree count to be the first column
  slice_max(tree_count, n = 5) #selecting top 5 groups for tree counts
```
